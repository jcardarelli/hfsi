General Administrative Amendments.
15.04.1.100 - Title.
This Chapter of the Oakland Municipal Code shall be known as the “Oakland Amendments Of
The 2022 Editions Of The California Building Standards Code, Part 1 (Administrative), Part
(Building), Part 2.5 (Residential), Part 3 (Electrical), Part 4 (Mechanical), Part 5 (Plumbing), Part
6 (Energy), Part 8 (Historical Buildings), Part 10 (Existing Buildings), and Part 11 (Green Building
Standards), Part 12 (Referenced Codes),” may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as
“this Chapter,” “this Code,” or the “2022 Oakland Building Construction Code.”
15.04.1.110 - Scope.
Where any section of a model code recited herein is amended by this Chapter, all provisions of the
original section not so specifically amended shall remain in full force and effect and all amended
provisions shall be considered as added thereto. Where provisions set forth herein conflict with
the provisions of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, Parts 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,
11 and 12, the enforcement of which by local jurisdictions is provided for in the Matrix Adoption
Tables, the provisions of the California Amendments shall prevail and control.
15.04.1.115 - General standards.
A. Hazards. All materials, assemblies, appliances, fixtures, equipment, and installations thereof;
all arrangements of occupancies, exits, aisles, stairs, and doors; all parapet walls, cornices,
spires, towers, tanks, statuary, signage, structural members, appendages, and appurtenances
thereto in buildings and structures regulated by this Code shall be so arranged, assembled,
installed, maintained and of sufficient size and so protected as to reduce and minimize all
egress, fire, safety, and health hazards.
B. Quality. The quality of all materials, assemblies, appliances, fixtures, and equipment; methods
of connection, assembly, and installation; allowable stress, strain, deflection, rate and volume
and velocity of flow, pressure, temperature, and ampacity; and assumed loads and capacities
to be used in the design and construction of all buildings and structures, plumbing and
mechanical installations, and electrical systems shall be consistent with requirements of this
Code and nationally recognized standards of quality and generally recognized and well-
established methods of testing, design, installation, and construction. Testing, listing, and
affixed labeling shall be prima facie evidence of conformity with approved standards for
safety to life and limb, property, and public welfare.

C. Compliance. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Code, including failure to
provide, obtain or maintain valid permits, certifications, tests, listings, affixed labeling,
inspection approvals, or other conditions of permit; failure to repair, demolish, remove, or
rehabilitate unsafe materials, appliances, fixtures, or equipment; or failure to prevent, restrain,
correct, or abate conditions unsafe or hazardous for egress or fire protection or health due to
inadequate maintenance, excess loading, dilapidation, or abandonment shall be and is declared
to be prima facie evidence of an existing and continuing hazard to life or limb, property or
public welfare.
15.04.1.120 - Effect of adoption and repeals.
A. Other Codes and Ordinances. Unless expressly stated herein, this Chapter is not intended
to amend, repeal, or supersede provisions of any other codes, regulations or ordinances,
including, but not limited to, the demolition ordinance, earthquake damage abatement
ordinance, dangerous building ordinance, creek protection ordinance, foreclosed and vacant
residential building ordinance, Planning Code, Building Maintenance Code, or Fire Code.
B. Conflict. In any specific section or case where there is a conflict within or between or among
provisions, the most restrictive that prescribes and establishes the higher standard of safety or
public benefit shall prevail and control and where there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall apply.
C. Validity. Neither the adoption of this Code nor the repeal by the ordinance codified in this
Chapter of any city ordinance shall in any manner affect the prosecution for violation of
ordinances, which violations were committed prior to the effective date hereof or be construed
as a waiver of any license or penalty at said effective date due and unpaid under such ordinance
relating to the collection of any such license or penalty or the penal provisions applicable to
any violations hereof.
Provided further, neither the adoption of this Code nor the repeal by the ordinance codified in this
Chapter of any City ordinance shall in any manner affect the validity of an interlocutory or final
action heretofore taken by the Hearing Examiner, or the validity of any such action to be taken
upon matters pending before the Hearing Examiner at the time of the adoption of the ordinance
codified in this Chapter, and that the provisions of this Code, insofar as they are substantially the
same as existing provisions relating to the same subject matter, shall be construed as restatement
and continuation thereof, and not as new enactment.
15.04.1.125 - Administrative hearings.
A. General. In order to appeal orders, decisions, or determinations made by the Building Official
relative to the application and interpretation of the non-administrative (technical)
requirements of this Code, any person adversely affected by the order, decision, or
determination may request an administrative hearing with a Hearing Officer. The request shall
be filed in writing with the Building Official and shall be accompanied by a fee as established
in the Master Fee Schedule.

The written request for an administrative hearing with the accompanying fee shall be received by
the Building Official within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date of the service of such
order, decision or determination of the Building Official, provided however, that if the building or
structure is in such condition as to make it Dangerous or an Imminent Hazard and is ordered
vacated in accordance with Section 15.08.380 of this Code, such request and fees shall be received
by the City within seven (7) calendar days from the date of the service of the Declaration or Order
of the Building Official. Failure to file such written request along with full payment of fees within
the period of time prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to an administrative
adjudication of such action or to any portion thereof and constitutes a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies.
The request for an administrative hearing shall contain the following information:
1. A brief statement setting forth the interest of the appellant in the real property identified
in the order, decision or determination made by the Building Official; and
2. A brief statement in ordinary and concise language of that (those) specific order(s),
decision(s) or determination(s) protested; and
3. A brief statement in ordinary and concise language contending that issuance of the order,
decision or determination was a result of error or abuse of discretion together with any
material facts claimed to support such contention; and
4. A brief statement in ordinary and concise language of the relief sought and the reasons
why it is claimed the protested order, decision or determination should be reversed,
modified, or otherwise set aside; and
5. The signature of the appellant, and his or her mailing address; and
6. The verification (by declaration under penalty of perjury) of at least one (1) person
requesting a hearing as to the truth of the matters stated in the request for hearing.
B. Scheduling and Noticing. As soon as practicable after receiving the request for administrative
hearing, the Building Official shall fix a date, time and place for the administrative hearing.
Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the appellant at least seven
(7) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. The failure of the Building Official to serve
any person required herein to be served shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to
any other person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed
by the provisions of this section.
C. Scope of Hearing. The administrative hearing before a hearing officer shall be an evidentiary
hearing. Only those technical matters or issues specifically raised by the appellant in the
request for administrative hearing shall be considered. The appellant and the City may present
witnesses and such documentary evidence as are relevant to the issues. The Hearing Officer

stamp the plans as provided in the California Building Code. Such approved plans shall not be
changed, modified or altered without authorization from the Building Official, and all work
regulated by this Code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.
The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of a part of an electrical system
before the entire plans and specifications for the whole system have been submitted or approved,
provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all
pertinent requirements of this Code. The holder of a partial permit may proceed without assurance
that the permit for the entire building, structure or electrical system will be granted.
B. One set of reviewed plans, diagrams, calculations, specifications and computations shall be
retained by the Building Official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of
approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant and said set shall be always
kept on the site of the building or work during which the work authorized thereby is in
progress.
C. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans, calculations, specifications, diagrams, and

A. Electrical equipment and systems for which permits are required by this Code shall be subject
to inspection by the Building Official and such electrical equipment and systems shall remain
accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the Building Official. It
shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the electrical equipment and systems to
remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the Building Official nor the
City of Oakland shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any
material required to permit inspection. When the installation of an electrical system or
equipment is complete, an additional and final inspection shall be made. Electrical systems
and equipment regulated by this Code shall not be connected to the energy supply lines until
authorized by the Building Official.
Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the
provisions of this Code or of other ordinances, rules, or regulations of the jurisdiction. Inspections
presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances
of the City of Oakland shall not be valid.
B. The requirements of this Section shall not be considered to prohibit the operation of
mechanical systems installed to replace existing equipment or fixtures serving an occupied
portion of the building in the event a request for inspection of such equipment or fixture has
been filed with the Building Official not more than forty-eight (48) hours after such
replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such electrical system is concealed
by any permanent portion of the building.
C. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the Building
Official that such work is ready for inspection. Every request for inspection shall be filed at
least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or
by telephone at the option of the Building Official. It shall be the duty of the person requesting
inspections required by this Code to provide access to and means for inspection of such work.
D. In addition to the called inspections required by this Code, the Building Official may make
or require other inspections of electrical work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of
this Code and other laws which are enforced by the Code Enforcement Agency.
E. A re-inspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or re-inspection when such portion
of work for which inspection is requested is not complete or when required corrections have
not been made. This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first
time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but as
controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for inspection or re­
inspection.
Re-inspection fees may be assessed, when the approved plans are not readily available to the
inspector for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. Re-inspection fees shall be established

and assessed in accordance with the Master Fee Schedule. In instances where re-inspection fees
have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees
have been paid.

be received with respect to any such meter installation or reinstallation or any such supply or
service connection or reconnection, authorized by the Building Official or the Building
Official's designated representative within thirty (30) days or more in residential occupancies
or ninety (90) days or more in other occupancies of previous authorization; provided further
that the Building Official may, at his or her discretion, waive temporarily or permanently any
or all requirements of this Section by giving written notice of such waiver to all persons
engaged in the distribution or sale of electrical energy; and said Building Official may likewise
at any time revoke such waiver by written notice to all such persons.
